# Contributing to SignIn

Pull requests will be accepted as long as they are working towards the
stated goals.  Goals for the project can be found in the
[requirements.md file](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/SignIn/blob/master/docs/requirements.md).

## First Steps towards a pull request

* [Make a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* (Optional) Check the [Issues page](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/SignIn/issues)
or the [requirements.md file](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/SignIn/blob/master/docs/requirements.md) for something you can contribute towards.
  * (Optional) If you do not see the item that you would like changed on
  those lists, submit a [new issue](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/SignIn/issues/new)
  for something that you would like to see changed.
* Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.  This will redirect you to a new
page titled YOURUSERNAME / SignIn.

## Pull request

* Create a new branch from your fork.  Name the branch based on what you
intend to change such as fixing-spelling-errors.
* Make changes.  Less is more.
* An option to create a pull request will appear at the top of the main page.
* Explain the reasoning behind the change in the pull request.

## After the pull request
(Optional) After a change is merged, you can delete the branch and make a new branch for the next change.  If you are
done working on the fork after the change, the repository can be deleted.

## Low hanging fruit

* I use minimalistic text editors without spell check.  US grammar corrections
will be accepted.
* If something is worded awkwardly, submit a pull request to add clarity.  If
you do not understand something enough to add clarity, submit a [new issue](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/SignIn/issues/new).
